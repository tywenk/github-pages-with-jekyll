Ternary expressions are a shorthand way to write `if else` statements.

Ternary expressions threw me off early on. The semantic structure of `if else` statement was easy to understand. If this expression returns truthy, then execute this expression. If it is not truthy, execute this other expression. Why fix something that aint broke?

The strange syntax of a `?` and the trailing `:` were confusing. I think it's because when reading a line of code, the `?` and `:` can be easily lost in the jumble of text and numebers.

Here's a breakdown of it, in plain English:

**if this is true `?` then do this `:` otherwise do this**

The usefulness of ternary expressions comes in handy when you want a single-line way to assign a variable a value dependent on another variable. Lets take these three lines that returns a `isFullyCharged` as `true` if our battery level is at 100%.

```
const batteryLevel = 26;
const isFullyCharged = batteryLevel == 100 ? true : false;

return isFullyCharged;
//false
```

Written out as an `if else` statement, and assuming we still want to return a new boolean variable, it comes out much longer.

```
const batteryLevel = 26;
let isFullyCharged;

if (batteryLevel == 100){
  isFullyCharged = true;
} else {
  isFullyCharged = false;
}

return isFullyCharged;
```

Ternary expressions are useful then for concise single-line checks that are actually quite readable once their at first strange syntax can be overcome.

And, as I've read more about them, they can also simplify more complex situtations, like nested checks, in which case using [chained ternary expressions](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/nested-ternaries-are-great-361bddd0f340) results in cleaner and less bug prone code.
